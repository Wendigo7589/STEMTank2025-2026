        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <h3>During Big stadium events (around 70,000 fans) there can be at least 10,000 to 20,000 kWH of energy used, which can also be enough for several hundred gallons of fuel used, and we found a way to fix that big problem. Everytime we move, we can create energy! Our team found a way to capture the energy. Inspired by Pavegens energy harvesting tiles, we designed a stadium seat that collects energy whenever someone sits and stands.

        <h1>Greener stadiums, Greener futures</h1>
        <h3>Sports can bring thousands of people together, But that results in stadiums using large amounts of electricity and resources. Our kinetic seat technology helps reduce these carbon footprints by providing a renewable energy source right from the Audience.

            By combining innovation with sustainability, we can keep supporting our favorite sport teams while protecting the earth
